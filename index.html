            In this app, there is some analysis about the Craiglist data set, the world’s largest collection of used vehicles for sale. We will find the following pages:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Craiglist's vehicles:</b> There are an introduction of the problem, how we are going to deal with it and also, we describe the variables we are going to use. </li><br>
          <li><b>Data description:</b> There are a left panel where we can select any of the variables we have defined before and the data frame description, where we can show a different number of entries, search any value or sort the variables. </li><br>
          
          <li><b>Descriptive analysis:</b> In the following panel, we are able to plot two graphics, an histogram and a barplot, to see the relationship between our target variable and the rest of predictors. </li><br>
          
          <li><b>Distribution of the vehicles:</b> In this page, we can observe two interactive maps of the USA: on the left, there is the location of the vehicles, and on the right, the quantity of vehicles on sale. </li><br>
          
          <li><b>Statistical models:</b> In this last page, we can perform some statistical and machine learning models, selecting the partition of the data that goes in the training set, the method of resampling and the model, which can be generalized linear model (glm), k nearest neighbors (knn), random forest (rf) or neural network (nnet).</li><br>
